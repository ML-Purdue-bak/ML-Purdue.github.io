<Item title='Time Series Forecasting for Air Pollution'>
In the Time Series forecasting for Air Quality/Pollution group, we are currently working on building an LSTM neural network model with the goal of predicting daily concentrations of PM10 (a pollution metric) in LA, California. We are also carrying out statistical analyses to contextualize why LA is highly polluted and come up with recommendations/policies to mitigate the effects of high pollution events.

<Item title='Eye disease detection'>
We are attempting to create a dataset of eye diseases taken from in front of the eye (something that can be recreated easily with any modern phone) and then attempting to use a neural network to detect what disease is present in the eye.

<Item title='Chatbots'>
Learn how to prompt and sample from Large Language Models(LLMs) to create chatbots. Weâ€™ll be working with models such as GPT-3(the one that powers ChatGPT) and others. End goal of the project is to make a modular, customizable chatbot that can be plugged into any platform(Discord, Slack, a website, etc.)
