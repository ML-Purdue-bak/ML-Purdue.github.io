I’m passionate about casually interacting with AI in our day to day lives. I aspire to be an AI Research Scientist in the future. My main interests are in robotics and NLP. I’ve had previous experience in CV, NLP, Information Retrieval, Deep RL, robotics, and conversational bots. I have done AI RnD internships at Amazon and Shield AI. Check out my website [here](https://jacobzietek.me/).

    Aref Malek
</span>
I'm broadly interested in AI and recently have been exploring Augmented Reality and Algorithms. 
I love to build projects that improve how we physically interact with AI, as well as the social science of everyday life. 
This semester, I'm excited to learn more about RL and robotics from my lab and finally take a deep dive into research. 
During my past internships at NASA and AWS, I developed new features on AI-based product teams.
Feel free to check out old projects and please don't hesitate to reach out to chat! Most of my information can be found on my [website](https://arefmalek.me/).

<Officer name="Ananya Singh">

I am a Junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science and Data Science with a Concentration in Machine Intelligence. My main interests lie in Software Engineering and Machine Learning. As a result, I have experiences exploring these areas during my time as a student through internships with Nintendo and Google, projects in SWE and NLP, as an officer for SIG AI, researcher in CV, and TA for Data Structures and Algorithms and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. In my free time, I enjoy exploring nature and music and writing articles about Data Science on Medium!

<Officer name="Sameeha Afrulbasha">
  Hey! I'm a sophomore studying data science and stats at Purdue. As an officer
  and project manager for ML@Purdue, I'm currently leading a project on time series
  forecasting. In my free time, I enjoy writing and posting about topics related
  to machine learning, AI, and stats. I also love trying new foods, boba/coffee
  runs, and playing badminton.
</Officer>

<Officer name="Stanley Kim">
  Hi! I am a freshman in Computer Science from Philadelphia, PA. This is my
  second semester in ACM and in ML@Purdue, where I am participating in the TE
  AI Cup Competition. Previously, I was a Software Engineer Intern at Quantic,
  and am currently involved in data science research on campus.

<Officer name="Saisravani Kuchibhotla">
  Hi, I'm a junior in Computer Science pursuing the Software Engineering and
  Machine Intelligence tracks. I worked on this website :D and I help manage SIG
  AI's socials. I like to paint, play video games, and cook in my free time.
</Officer>
<Officer name="Anna Shen">
  Hi! I'm a senior in computer engineering, and served as an officer, project
  manager, website dev, and as the 2022 SIG AI President. I'm hoping to go into
  consumer product software development after graduation. I've interned
  previously for Cisco and Nucor. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, calligraphy,
  attending hackathons, building mechanical keyboards, and caring for my
  plethora of houseplants. I'm passionate about improving quality of life for
  others, my coffee and matcha, and I especially love birds.
</Officer>
<Officer name="Jinen Setpal">
  Hey everyone! I'm really interested in research on machine interpretability,
  and building optimization routines based on interpretability techniques. I
  believe that building an understandable basis for training neural networks
  goes a long way towards making black-box models more generalizable, and I'm
  currently working to explore that! [Website](https://jinensetpal.github.io/)

<Officer name="Sagar Patil">
  Hi! I'm a Sophomore studying Computer Science, I like rockets, computers, and
  neural networks.
