- Ananya Singh: My main interests lie in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence + Machine Learning. As a result, I have experiences exploring these areas during my time as a student through internships with Nintendo and Google, projects in SWE and NLP, SIG AI, research in CV, and as a TA for Data Structures and Algorithms and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. In my free time, I enjoy exploring nature and music and writing articles about Data Science on Medium!

- Sameeha Afrulbasha: Hey! I'm a sophomore studying data science and stats at Purdue. As an officer and project manager for SIGAI, I'm currently leading a project on time series forecasting. In my free time, I enjoy writing and posting about topics related to machine learning, AI, and stats. I also love trying new foods, boba/coffee runs, and playing badminton.

- Stanley Kim: Stanley is a freshman in Computer Science from Philadelphia, PA. This is his second semester in ACM and in Purdue SIGAI, where he is participating in the TE AI Cup Competition. Previously, he was a Software Engineer Intern at Quantic, and is currently involved in data science research on campus. In his free time, he can be found working on projects, working out, and relaxing around campus.

- Saisravani Kuchibhotla: Hi, I'm a junior in Computer Science pursuing the Software Engineering and Machine Intelligence tracks. I worked on this website :D and I help manage SIG AI's socials. I like to paint, play video games, and cook in my free time.
