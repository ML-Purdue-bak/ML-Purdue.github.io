> SIGAI is a group of people interested in discussing artificial intelligence and working on projects related to all aspects of artificial intelligence.

# Spring 2023 Board:

## President: Jacob Zietek
I’m passionate about casually interacting with AI in our day to day lives. I aspire to be an AI Research Scientist in the future. My main interests are in robotics and NLP. I’ve had previous experience in CV, NLP, Information Retrieval, Deep RL, robotics, and conversational bots. I have done AI RnD internships at Amazon and Shield AI. Check out my website [here](https://jacobzietek.me/).

## Vice President: Aref
I'm into Artificial Intelligence and recently have been exploring Augmented Reality and Algorithms. I like building projects that improve how we physically interact with AI, as well as exploring the social science of everyday systems. In my past internships at AWS and NASA, I've worked in teams that release CV teams for both. I'm excited to learn more about RL and NLP in the future. Feel free to check out some of my old projects and my contact info on my [website](https://arefmalek.me/).

## Officers:

- Ananya Singh: I am a Junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science and Data Science with a Concentration in Machine Intelligence. My main interests lie in Software Engineering and Machine Learning. As a result, I have experiences exploring these areas during my time as a student through internships with Nintendo and Google, projects in SWE and NLP, as an officer for SIG AI, researcher in CV, and TA for Data Structures and Algorithms and Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. In my free time, I enjoy exploring nature and music and writing articles about Data Science on Medium!

- Sameeha Afrulbasha: Hey! I'm a sophomore studying data science and stats at Purdue. As an officer and project manager for SIGAI, I'm currently leading a project on time series forecasting. In my free time, I enjoy writing and posting about topics related to machine learning, AI, and stats. I also love trying new foods, boba/coffee runs, and playing badminton.

- Stanley Kim: Stanley is a freshman in Computer Science from Philadelphia, PA. This is his second semester in ACM and in Purdue SIGAI, where he is participating in the TE AI Cup Competition. Previously, he was a Software Engineer Intern at Quantic, and is currently involved in data science research on campus. In his free time, he can be found working on projects, working out, and relaxing around campus.

- Saisravani Kuchibhotla: Hi, I'm a junior in Computer Science pursuing the Software Engineering and Machine Intelligence tracks. I worked on this website :D and I help manage SIG AI's socials. I like to paint, play video games, and cook in my free time. 

- Anna Shen: Hi! I'm a senior in computer engineering, and served as an officer, project manager, website dev, and as the 2022 SIG AI President. I'm hoping to go into consumer product software development after graduation. I've interned previously for Cisco and Nucor. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, calligraphy, attending hackathons, building mechanical keyboards, and caring for my plethora of houseplants. I'm passionate about improving quality of life for others, my coffee and matcha, and I especially love birds.

- Jinen Setpal: Hey everyone! I'm really interested in research on machine interpretability, and building optimization routines based on interpretability techniques. I believe that building an understandable basis for training neural networks goes a long way towards making black-box models more generalizable, and I'm currently working to explore that!
